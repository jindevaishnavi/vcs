Version Control Software VCS is also referred as SCM (Source Code Management) 
tools or RCS (Revision Control System).

Version control is a way to keep a track of the changes in the code so that 
if something goes wrong, we can make comparisons in different code versions 
and revert to any previous version that we want.
It is very much required where multiple developers are continuously working 
on changing the source code.
